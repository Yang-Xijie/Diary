## 201201

〇 空手道课进攻防守的感觉真心不错！

N oj写了一个下午都没什么进展。。。

〇 普通的每天，尽量在思维上让其变得不同吧

## 201202

L Concentrated in pde class. With heart, things be easier.

L Finished online judge case 8 which is a little bit hard for me. Spent so many hours thinking about it. Make up a case to 'fly bitch' is easy. Though for oob flying is difficult. However, it gave me a lot.

L Active in social circles today. Sometimes be quite and sometimes be active should be the best status.

## 201203

Exhausted today...

From 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock now, almost working all the time! physics class, tought about MATLAB, decided courses to take next semester, made the article, observed bugs in codes, learnt git.

I suddenly found that Git is probably the most difficult and complicated app I've ever used. With so many commands, situations to solve and countless solutions, I don't think I could master it well. Just learn it! A piece of good news is that new commands 'restore' and 'switch' are clear and easy to comprehend.

おやすみ

## 201204

Forgot to write something last night.

A charming day! Finished git learning which let me master a powerful tool. Learnt physics about quantum, but not so marvelous. Combatted with OJ9, consulted classmates and gained a lot.

Found a great vedio help me drop into dream, thanks a lot!

## 201205

L Get up early today to help classmates modify powerpoint to be shown the day after tomorrow. I have the ability to find things not balanced in docs, which is a great improment.

X Combatted with OJ9 but failed in the end. In all, it took me about a whole and a half day! Not worthing maybe, apart from some new comprehension...

L Went to a small meeting. However what was really important was chatting with Zihan after the meeting. The chat covered various parts, from goals, work, courses, to cities, state, etc. Really relaxed after that. For a long time I haven't chatted about my goals with others. Thanks a lot!

L Revised my schedule of the next semester. Ahh, time-consuming... 

L Reserved a seat at 8:00 tomorrow. Hope I will get up before eight.

## 201206

X Last night, two students talked in mid-room which annoyed me. Luckily, I stopped them or I could't sleep,at all.

N Comfused with physics quantum part...

L Had a great time this evening with classmates.

X Time is tight! So many things to do!

L Come on!

## 201208

emmm昨晚太困了没上闹钟没写日记就直接睡着了。还好早上九点半醒来了，不然课都要错过了...

So, combine two days into one diary!

### yesterday
N On class electronic circuit and system, took a nap for several ppts... Luckily used class interval to cover missed knowledge. Come on! Don't be disperated! Keep going!

L Finish homework in one day. That feeling is geart. Just push yourself and time will be more and more.

L On map2 class, a teacher in 光电所 introduced a lot Nobel Prize in the history. After the lecture, great interests were inspired!

### today
L Took a view at the methodology of algorithm design. Emmm important? Sure. Also reviewed learnt algorithms on the class.

L Got three 無防備 when taking karate exam...

L Read Apple proRes white paper! That's like the textbook concerning video transcode! After reading it, also take my hard disk storage in consideration, I really want to use Prores 422 LT as the target codec! But maybe proxy is the best choice because LT is still space_consuming...

L Got a reply on github!

Really happy! Just like having got the first comment at CSDN!

## 201209

X Got up so late... Might be so tired yesterday.

L Finally decided my choice on how to import media into FCP. If you could make a choice, you probably not fully understand the diffences between the different choices. Now I could even list several advantages of my choice! That feeling is so great that I think the time spent was worth it.

L Put great significance on English learning. I don't want to be an exchange student. But summer school or panel research abroad attarct me a lot  So, get a good TOLEF grade earlier...

X Still feel confused these days facing countless tasks. Come on!

## 201210

X It seems something has gone wrong with my left earphone. Feel really uncomfortable listening to left channel.

X Surprised by EE experiment because progess is far reached. The pattern shown on the oscilloscope was in chaos. My pattner and I once thought it a piece of cake...

X A little of bias leads to failure totally. For bad formatting before import, FCP cannot transcode the media with the progress stuck at 0 percent. (Complain about no eletricity after 11 pm which can't be more friendly to me. Or I could have finished all my transcode tonight.)

X Caught a cold... Maybe from 3 days ago. No wonder had a sore throat.

## 201211

X My fever becomes worse... Bouhght medicine and hope it willget better soon.

L Spent a lot of time watching official videos of SwiftUI. I could believe creating an app can be that easy! Feel obsessed on it. Develop my own app in the winter holiday!!!

L Got Kudafter! Watch later~

X Big Sur ate my cursur all the time... and today App Store crashes... Awful experience. I dont want to restart so often.

## 201212

已经记不起来昨天干了什么了。。。

准备晚上的实践宣讲很久，结果也没有人问我问题。做CAD大概三四个小时，结果最后电流点错了今早起来才发现。

对了，写了OJ10，OJ就此结束。要开始复习科目了。虽说只过了八个点，但是这次OJ还是写得挺开心的，思路比较清晰。话说cyt真大佬啊

## 201213

Today it was really dangerous. Suddenly lost all interests...

Grateful to my high school roommate, mood switched.

Come on for map2 test tomorrow!

And, finish poem hw soon, hopefully.

## 201214

〇 あぁ、祭のことが好き。好ーき。大好き。好きすぎ。。。

L The pancake in Taoli at the east window is delicious~ Ate it this morning for getting up early~ but still arrived at the classroom a little bit late.

L Test of map2 finished!

L Feel happy today. Thanks a lot to lots of things~

## 201215

今天嘛，大概一直在睡觉，想的东西很少，想轻松一些...

洗澡换了身新的衣服，好暖和~

## 201216

L Dreamt a dream about my learning Japanese. Suddenly want to master Japanese for matsuri...

L Finished huge part of homework~ feel relaxed now~

L Happy today with funny videos/lives. Thanks a lot!

N emmm START final test review! PLEASE!

## 201217

ummm, I should keep updating this on SimpleBook! First, wanted to sleep directly. But after a while, recording should be better, I thought.

X Feel unclear about pyhsics, part of quatumn. Come on, to practice with concrete numbers and formula, read the materials. Won't be a big problem.

L Appreciate matsuri~ 'nothing but matsuri is cute!' The high EQ also attracts me. Thanks a lot!

X Really confused by the EE experiment. I can't find out where went wrong... It's just like a joke from the god? What a mess. Besides it's a teamwork, so it's hard to give it up by myself...

## 201218

201218

L Watched matsuri until... 5 o'clock... Various of videos be watched, many kinds of character be felt. Feel a little bit envious of her famlily, with her great younger brother and mother.

L Yesterday... finished review of pde. Thanks to a professional TA who taught these questions with really clear thoughts! However, in the evening another TA shocked me with his bad tricks... Though I figured out all question in the end.

L Dropped a nap in the library then missed second selection of courses. Luckily nothing wrong happened.

## 201219

L Got clean after a shower...

X Still feel bad when thinking this world being complex. Bunches of information bump into mu brain. That feeling is so bad.

## 201220

X Suddenly got a runny nose as arriving at the lobrary next to a senior student... But felt better with a sleep in the after (got up at 8 p.m....

L matsuri chann is so indecent... a girl with various characters. so so so.

## 201221

总之很迷茫就对了，一天也没干什么事情

看了matsuri APEX抽卡的那一回，480w可太可怕了。。。

整理了kurumi的表情包~可以用起来了~

## 201222

L Four courses ended for this semester~ DA, karate, poem, pde? Time flies? Things happened a lot.

L Got a new song called... emmm the vocal bgm of galgame... which I want to give it a try in the winter holiday. Love the melody and the pace~

L It seemed that hololive made it with the stage live. Also matsuri chan did her best. That's so great! Come on!

X Start reveiwing,,,, to review!!!

## 201223

L How to say it... Not get to dreamland until 5 am? Just was looking for videos of matsuri... with yashiro. These two vtb are great pattner! Of course that was too late, so drop into dreamland earlier next time!

L Refused by teacher in the ee lab. Felt frustated but contacted with my partner to explain the situation and set next plan. Things went well, come on! Besides, thankful to my reliable partner, bug was found.

X Sleepy when listening to the last ee class. Simutaneously, tried to find deleted videos about matsuri but failed. No problem! Things will be done.

## 201224

今天在想，用英文写日记真的能提升英文水平吗。。。确实能帮助我回忆起很多单词，但是完全没有提升啊喂，可能还会让我只是记住自己错误的表达。何况英文表意我实在不擅长，感觉掌握的日语形容词都要比英语多，那为什么要用英语写日记呢。。。写文档教程什么的还是上英语吧。

今天状态也挺差的吧，物理课听完昏昏的，吃了个饭到了主楼就开始睡觉没想到睡了好久好久！emmm。实验做出来了，找到问题十五分钟就搞定了。然而后面的分频器和滤波器好像没什么希望uuuu。早点写完实验报告吧。

开始复习复变，稍微有点底吧。

下定决心要学日语了，掌握的那种。

看了matsuri的单人演唱曲目~No.1。遗憾的是搜了一波没有歌词呀。便装和清楚的声线本当に助かる，蹦蹦跳跳真可爱~wwww

## 201226

昨天的话。。。没写因为睡得很晚然后就摸了。。。

所以昨天一天都干嘛了呢？没有课11点起来，晚上听了数算的辅导，回来之后就开始摸鱼了，看日语书什么的。下午大概在复习复变，复习了微积分之类的，那个什么y导加Py等于Q的解真的是太糟糕了，课件一句话我简直裂开。

今天就一直在集体自习了。效率真的很高！看到了考研的事情，觉得，害，来到了清华这些事情确实很少需要考虑，甚至说，和那些院校的同学的思维方式都不同了，因为担心的事情并不一样。

一天复变的学习逐渐让我觉得复变还好，可以接受。

看了matsuri单推的ひまわり的视频，大概被她的智商可爱到了。。。啊这

## 201227

嘛，逐渐对日记变得不上心了起来呢〜我是不是不要变成一个没趣的人了呢

〇 tc全部下了，official下了一半。好像很久都在做这件事。熟肉的话没希望了打算放弃了。今天因为这个伤心了好久。就好像，自己喜欢的人突然消失了，这样。（因为B站和YouTube同时没有以前的档这就离谱啊，看到official上400多稍微心安了一些~

〇 嘛，matsuri一定喜欢yashiro吧，能感觉来啦。幸せに。哪天matsuri突然向yashiro表白什么的也不会很奇怪吧。关键yashiro太温柔了啊！

〇 复习加油！应该没什么问题的！今天还写了电电报告！問題ない！

〇 やはり日本語を勉強したい。

## 201228

〇 起得很晚吧，昨晚几乎没睡，随便翻了好多视频。

〇 下好了官方号所有的408个视频。应该，足够了，吧

〇 写了今年的听歌报告，emmm最近对音乐不是很上心所以写得怪怪的感觉。

〇 在复习的时候尝试从长远的角度想了想未来的规划，感觉清楚多了。现实确实会有很多压力，不过用自己的步伐总能顺利应对吧。

## 201229

〇 昨晚完全被ひいろxまつり治愈掉了，这两人太甜了吧！然后还有转生糖！）然后逐渐发现自己变成了dd（wwww

〇 还是起的很晚，但是感觉状态好很多。整理掉了数理方程的笔记（很认真的）。还是打算发出来，虽然说明天考试今天发可能挺迷惑的，但我确实今天才整理完啊。而且我觉得思路也还ok，那就发吧。

〇 风超级大...今天停车就没锁车直接扔到地上...出门就戴口罩因为太冷了。话说骑车回来耳朵都要没掉。

〇 明天加油吧，只希望心态不炸。

## 201230

〇 只睡了六个小时还是有点困，下午趴在桌子上有又睡了会儿。昨晚好像心情很差，看了hicchan和matsuri的第二天tc。嘛，早点找到状态吧

〇 考试，怎么说，还算顺利。记不太清楚的地方都直接强行链接了，总体思路是差不多的。这次老师真算手下留情了，没出什么摸不着的题目。

〇 换了桌面的壁纸，希望能带来好的心情。

X 我觉得集体自习是干不起来了。自己玩吧

〇 网站组有锅了！好开心！终于有锅了，这说明有事情做了真棒啊。（不过刷了会儿代码发现，macOS事儿真多，我估计打开外部difftool的时候遇到了权限问题，然后terminal的配置出问题导致每次输入命令之后都会卡住...这点真心挺烦的。（另外发现git graph是真的好用啊！！（还有git的命令还得再多接触啊，很多时候我要的功能就是一行命令的事情

N 挺讨厌考试复习这段时间的。因为，你除了复习几乎什么都做不了。（当然你也可以摸鱼hh

## 201231

大概是混沌的一天。昨晚写AppleScript学到四点多，改好传上去差不多四点半。看了会儿视频六点多睡。。。这作息逐渐变得“规律”了起来。

收到了新iPad，嘛，感觉还不错，没有那么难用。不过有些bug真的太烦心了。比如iPad自己更新不了系统。后来连上mac才升了。试了试随航，可能是iPad的屏幕分辨率太低了吧，看着那个选项框都很模糊而且不能调整分辨率。延时我觉得也不小啊，我用的是有线好吧。而且双指滑动做的和duet差不多，都很不人性化。何况我也没有pencil。要买还是买Pro吧，普通的这个，估计也就看看视频玩玩游戏什么的，高一点的追求真的不能有。

复习电电，但说实话没什么复习的动力...
